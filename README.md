Description:
	
      Chess is a two-player board game played on a chessboard, a checkered game board (usually black and white) with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six-piece types moves differently. The most powerful piece is the queen and the least powerful piece is the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.
